Macintosh freeware game Galaxis.

Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a starfield. 
To find them, you can place probes that look in all eight compass 
directions and tell you how many lifeboats they see.  Your 
objective: find the lifeboats as quickly as possible, before the 
stranded passengers run out of oxygen!"
